# Personal-Finance-Tracker
This project is a SQL-based personal finance tracker which is designed to monitor income, expenses, and budgets. Built entirely in MySQL and demonstrates the ability to design a relational database schema, populate it with sample data, and run a variety of analytical queries to derive financial insights.

## Project Overview
The database is structured to answer common personal finance questions, such as:
- What was the total spending in each expense category for a given month?
- how does my spending compare to my monthly budget?
- what is my net cash flow over time?
- what are my largest transactions in a given period?
- what is the running balance of my primary bank account after each transaction?
